You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
